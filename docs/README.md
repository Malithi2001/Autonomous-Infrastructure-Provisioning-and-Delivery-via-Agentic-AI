## Documentation Rules

- Keep docs aligned with code and Makefile commands.
- Do not document real secrets, tokens, keys, passwords, or private repository data.
- Mark future work clearly instead of describing it as complete.
- Prefer exact endpoint paths, ports, environment variables, and command names.
- Keep AWS, Terraform, Prometheus, and Kubernetes as future work unless explicitly implemented.
- Avoid claiming full production autonomy; this project intentionally uses approval gates and pull requests.
