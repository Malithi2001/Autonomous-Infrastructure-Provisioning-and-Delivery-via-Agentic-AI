# System Architecture

This document describes the current architecture of the Smart DevOps Assistant. It is written from the live codebase, not from the original proposal.

## 1. Purpose

The system is a CI/CD automation assistant with safety controls. Its main job is to help a user:

- inspect a repository,
- detect the stack and CI/CD readiness,
- generate GitHub Actions workflow YAML,
- create workflow pull requests safely,
- diagnose failed CI/CD logs,
- recommend fixes,
- create selected fix pull requests,
- require human approval for risky actions,
- keep an audit trail.

Docker and shell capabilities exist only as optional local infrastructure inspection tools. They are not required for the core GitHub CI/CD workflow.

```

## 3. Frontend Architecture

Location: `frontend/src/`

The frontend is a React + Vite + TypeScript application. It provides the demo and operator interface for the system.

Main screens:

| Page | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `LoginPage.tsx` | User login and session creation. |
| `DashboardPage.tsx` | Overview screen for demo status and navigation. |
| `ChatPage.tsx` | Legacy chat agent interface. |
| `MultiAgentPage.tsx` | Deterministic multi-agent supervisor demo. |
| `DiagnosisPage.tsx` | Paste CI/CD logs and receive failure prediction. |
| `RepositorySetupPage.tsx` | Scan GitHub repo, view readiness, create workflow PR. |
| `WorkflowFailuresPage.tsx` | View failed GitHub Actions diagnoses and create fix PRs. |
| `ApprovalsPage.tsx` | Review and decide pending human approvals. |
| `ExecutionsPage.tsx` | Audit trail and execution history. |
| `EvaluationPage.tsx` | Project evaluation metrics and presentation support. |
| `SettingsPage.tsx` | Runtime settings such as API base URL for packaged clients. |
| `UsersPage.tsx` | Admin user management. |

Important frontend modules:

- `services/api.ts`: centralized Axios API client.
- `store/authStore.ts`: user session and authentication state.
- `store/chatStore.ts`: chat session state.
- `store/themeStore.ts`: theme state.
- `lib/rbac.ts`: frontend role visibility helpers.
- `components/layout/Layout.tsx`: authenticated app shell and navigation.

The frontend does not store GitHub tokens. Repository access is handled by the backend.

## 4. Backend API Architecture

Location: `backend/app/`

The backend is a FastAPI application with route modules organized by domain.

| Route module | Prefix | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `health.py` | `/health` | Health checks. |
| `auth.py` | `/api/v1/auth` | Login, register, refresh, logout, users, roles. |
| `agent.py` | `/api/v1/agent` | Legacy chat, multi-agent orchestration, WebSocket chat. |
| `cicd.py` | `/api/v1/cicd` | Offline file-list analysis and workflow YAML generation. |
| `repositories.py` | `/api/v1/repositories` | GitHub repo scan, installed repos, workflow PR creation. |
| `model.py` | `/api/v1/model` | CI/CD failure prediction. |
| `webhooks.py` | `/api/v1/webhooks` | GitHub App and workflow-run webhook events. |
| `workflow_failures.py` | `/api/v1/workflow-failures` | Stored workflow failure diagnoses and fix PR creation. |
| `approvals.py` | `/api/v1/approvals` | Human approval queue and decisions. |
| `executions.py` | `/api/v1/executions`, `/api/v1/audit` | Execution and audit history. |

Routes are intentionally thin. They validate requests, enforce RBAC, call services or agents, and return Pydantic response models.

## 5. Multi-Agent Architecture

Location: `backend/app/agents/`

The multi-agent path is deterministic. The Orchestration Agent receives a task, scores possible intents, extracts context, selects one specialized agent, and returns an `AgentResult`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Frontend
    participant API as /api/v1/agent/orchestrate
    participant O as Orchestration Agent
    participant A as Specialized Agent
    participant S as Service or Tool
    participant DB as Database

    UI->>API: message + context
    API->>O: AgentTask
    O->>O: Extract repo, run id, branch, logs, container name
    O->>O: Score CLI, CI/CD, Diagnosis, GitHub routes
    O->>A: Delegate to one agent
    A->>S: Execute supported service/tool call
    S->>DB: Store audit/domain record where needed
    S-->>A: Result
    A-->>O: AgentResult
    O-->>API: Structured result
    API-->>UI: Response
```

Agents:

- `OrchestrationAgent`: deterministic routing and context extraction.
- `CICDAgent`: stack detection and offline GitHub Actions YAML generation.
- `DiagnosisAgent`: CI/CD failure log classification and recommendation.
- `GitHubAgent`: GitHub repository scan, workflow actions, log download, fix PR path.
- `CLIAgent`: optional safe local container inspection, currently list containers and read logs.
- `DevOpsAgent`: legacy LangChain chat agent kept for compatibility.

## 6. Service Layer

Location: `backend/app/services/`

Services contain business logic:

| Service | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `repo_analyzer.py` | Detect stack, framework, package manager, project directories, existing workflows, CI warnings. |
| `workflow_generator.py` | Generate GitHub Actions YAML for Node, Python, Java, Docker, generic, and multi-project repos. |
| `cicd_readiness_service.py` | Score CI/CD readiness and produce strengths, findings, and next actions. |
| `failure_prediction_service.py` | Lazy-load model artifacts and predict failure label, confidence, suggested fix. |
| `fix_recommendation_service.py` | Build practical fix recommendations from predicted label and repo context. |
| `workflow_failure_service.py` | Store and list GitHub Actions failure diagnosis records. |
| `fix_pr_service.py` | Create selected safe fix PRs or pending approval records. |
| `github_app_service.py` | GitHub App JWT, installation tokens, installed repo records, webhook signature verification. |
| `hitl_service.py` | Approval request helpers. |
| `audit_service.py` | Execution/audit records with sensitive value redaction. |
| `memory_service.py` | Persistent chat history abstraction. |
| `execution_service.py` | Execution lifecycle helpers. |
| `ws_manager.py` | WebSocket connection management helper. |

## 7. Tool Layer

Location: `backend/app/tools/`

Tools isolate integrations:

| Tool | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `github_tool.py` | Repository tree, analysis snapshots, logs, workflows, branches, files, pull requests. |
| `docker_tool.py` | Optional local container inspection and controlled container operations. |
| `monitoring_tool.py` | Local process, metrics, and HTTP health checks. |
| `shell_tool.py` | Strict allowlisted shell command execution. |

The core CI/CD flow depends on GitHub tooling, not Docker.

## 8. Data Model

Location: `backend/app/models/models.py`

Main tables:

| Model | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `User` | User account with email, username, password hash, role, active flag. |
| `UserSession` | Refresh token session tracking. |
| `ChatMessage` | Persistent chat memory by session. |
| `ApprovalRequest` | Pending, approved, rejected, or timed-out human approval requests. |
| `Execution` | Audit history for API, agent, webhook, and approval actions. |
| `WorkflowFailure` | Stored diagnosis for failed GitHub Actions workflow runs. |
| `RepositoryInstallation` | GitHub App installation to repository mapping. |
| `AutomationRule` | Future automation policy model. |

## 9. CI/CD Repository Setup Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Repository Setup Page
    participant API as Repository API
    participant GH as GitHub API
    participant Analyzer as Repo Analyzer
    participant Ready as Readiness Service
    participant Gen as Workflow Generator
    participant DB as Database

    UI->>API: Scan repository
    API->>GH: Fetch tree and selected manifest files
    GH-->>API: File paths and analysis inputs
    API->>Analyzer: detect_stack
    Analyzer-->>API: stack + warnings
    API->>Ready: assess_cicd_readiness
    Ready-->>API: score + findings
    API->>DB: Audit repository analysis
    API-->>UI: scan result

    UI->>API: Create workflow PR
    API->>GH: Create branch
    API->>Gen: Generate workflow YAML
    Gen-->>API: Validated YAML
    API->>GH: Commit workflow file and open PR
    API->>DB: Audit PR creation
    API-->>UI: PR URL
```

## 10. Failure Diagnosis Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[GitHub workflow_run completed] --> B{Conclusion failure?}
    B -->|No| C[Ignore safely]
    B -->|Yes| D[Download Actions logs]
    D --> E[Clean and limit log excerpt]
    E --> F[Failure Prediction Service]
    F --> G[Fix Recommendation Service]
    G --> H[WorkflowFailure table]
    H --> I[Workflow Failures UI]
    I --> J[Optional fix PR]
    J --> K[Approval if required]
    K --> L[Branch + Commit + Pull Request]
```

## 11. Security And Safety

- Access tokens are accepted from Authorization bearer headers or the configured httpOnly cookie.
- Refresh tokens are stored in `user_sessions`.
- RBAC is enforced in backend route dependencies.
- Public self-signup is limited to viewer/developer accounts.
- Admin/operator accounts must be created by an admin.
- GitHub webhook signatures are verified when a webhook secret is configured.
- GitHub App installation tokens are preferred for installed repositories.
- PAT fallback exists for local MVP testing.
- GitHub modifications use pull requests, not direct pushes to protected branches.
- High-risk or medium-risk agent actions can create pending approval requests.
- Audit records redact known secret fields and truncate large values.

## 12. Deployment Topology

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Browser[Browser] --> Frontend[Frontend Container or Vite Dev Server]
    Frontend --> Backend[FastAPI Backend]
    Backend --> DB[(PostgreSQL or SQLite)]
    Backend --> Redis[(Redis)]
    Backend --> GitHub[GitHub API]
    Redis --> Worker[Celery Worker]
    Redis --> Flower[Flower Monitor]
```

The project can run locally with SQLite or in a container topology with backend, frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery worker, and Flower. Electron desktop and Capacitor Android builds package the frontend experience, but both still depend on a reachable backend API.

## 13. Known Boundaries

The project currently focuses on GitHub CI/CD automation. AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Prometheus production monitoring, and fully autonomous remediation are future extensions unless specifically requested.
