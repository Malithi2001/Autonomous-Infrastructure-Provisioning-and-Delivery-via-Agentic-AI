# Agentic AI-Powered Smart DevOps Assistant

**Agentic AI-Powered Smart DevOps Assistant for Autonomous Software Delivery and Infrastructure Management** is a supervisor-demo-ready CI/CD automation assistant.

The application helps a user scan a GitHub repository, detect its stack, generate GitHub Actions workflows, diagnose failed CI/CD logs with a trained ML model, recommend practical fixes, and propose safe pull requests with approval and audit controls.

The project is designed to demonstrate a controlled automation loop. It is not intended to make uncontrolled production changes.

## What This Project Proves

The MVP demonstrates this end-to-end flow:

1. A user logs in through the web app.
2. The user scans a GitHub repository or pastes CI/CD logs.
3. The backend detects project stack, package managers, existing workflows, and CI/CD readiness.
4. The system generates GitHub Actions workflow YAML for the detected stack.
5. Workflow changes are proposed through a branch and pull request.
6. GitHub webhook events can trigger diagnosis when workflow runs fail.
7. Real GitHub Actions logs are downloaded when credentials allow it.
8. A trained text classifier predicts the failure category and confidence.
9. A recommendation service suggests a practical fix.
10. Higher-risk actions wait for human approval.
11. Agent actions, GitHub actions, model predictions, approvals, and failures are audit logged.

The Orchestration Agent detects intent, selects exactly one specialized agent for the main task, and returns a structured result to the route layer. Existing route handlers stay thin and delegate business logic to agents or services.

- pytest, flake8, mypy

Frontend:

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.11 required. Python 3.13 is not supported for this MVP because pinned ML packages may fail to install.
- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm
- Git
- Docker Desktop only if you want the full Compose stack or Docker tool checks

Create local environment files from the safe templates. This command never overwrites existing `.env` files:

```bash
make init-env
```

Install dependencies. The backend virtualenv is created with Python 3.11:

```bash
make setup
```

For a normal web demo, start the backend and frontend in separate terminals:

```bash
make backend
make frontend
```

Open:

```text
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
Health check: http://localhost:8000/health
```

Default local admin values are defined in `backend/.env.example` for demo databases:

```text
Email: admin@example.com
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

Change these before exposing the application outside a local demo.

## Docker Compose

Run the full local stack with PostgreSQL, Redis, backend, frontend, Celery worker, and Flower:

```bash
make init-env
make dev
```

Build and run the stack:

```bash
make init-env
make dev-build
```

Useful Compose commands:

```bash
make docker-logs
make docker-down
```

The frontend is exposed at `http://localhost:5173`, the backend at `http://localhost:8000`, and Flower at `http://localhost:5555`.

## Web, Desktop, And Mobile Modes

Web mode is the default. Login, JWT cookies, RBAC, role visibility, approvals, and audit logging remain enabled.

Desktop mode is for local single-user desktop demos. It opens as `Desktop User`, bypasses JWT/RBAC checks, hides Users & Roles and Sign out, keeps approval gates for risky actions, and records audit actions as `desktop_user`.

Desktop mode environment:

```bash
DESKTOP_MODE=true
DISABLE_AUTH=true
VITE_DESKTOP_MODE=true
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Run desktop development mode:

```bash
make desktop-dev
```

Build the Windows desktop installer:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
.\desktop\setup-windows.ps1
```

The installer is created under `desktop\dist`.

Mobile mode packages the React frontend with Capacitor. The backend still runs separately and must be reachable from the phone or emulator.

```bash
make mobile-sync
make mobile-open-android
make mobile-apk-debug
```

See [docs/MOBILE_APP.md](docs/MOBILE_APP.md) for LAN IP, ngrok, Android Studio, and APK troubleshooting.

## GitHub Integration

For real repository scans, workflow PRs, log downloads, and webhook diagnosis, configure either a GitHub App or a local PAT fallback in backend environment variables.

Recommended GitHub App permissions:

- Metadata: read
- Contents: read and write
- Pull requests: read and write
- Actions: read
- Workflows: read and write

Recommended webhook events:

- `workflow_run`
- `installation`
- `installation_repositories`

Webhook URL shape:

```text
https://your-public-backend/api/v1/webhooks/github
```

GitHub cannot call private `localhost` URLs. Use a public HTTPS tunnel for local webhook testing.

Do not put GitHub tokens, private keys, API keys, JWT secrets, or database passwords in frontend files or committed `.env` files.

## ML Model

The failure classifier lives under `backend/app/ml/`.

Runtime artifacts:

```text
backend/app/ml/failure_model.joblib
backend/app/ml/fix_mapping.joblib
```

Retrain the model:

```bash
make train-model
```

Prediction responses include at least:

- `label`
- `confidence`
- `suggested_fix`

Empty logs are handled gracefully, and prediction requests do not retrain the model.

## Safety Principles

- Never push directly to `main` or `master`.
- GitHub repository changes must go through branch, commit, and pull request.
- High-risk actions require human approval.
- The system never auto-merges pull requests.
- Tokens, private keys, passwords, and secret-bearing environment values must not be logged or committed.
- Webhook signatures are verified when a webhook secret is configured.
- Frontend RBAC improves UX, but backend permission checks are the security boundary.
- Docker and CLI capabilities are optional local inspection features, not required for the core CI/CD workflow.
